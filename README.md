# Bingo Sheet
This game was created for a project in 2022-2023. It was a simple way to practice utilizing JOptionPane, using images from the PC/Laptop in the code, and random numbers.

## Building and Running
- In the past, I've used both Eclipse and IntelliJ to compile and run this project. Feel free to use whatever is most convenient and works for you.
- Be sure all the PNGs are in the same directory as the Java file. If not, you'll have to change pieces of code to access the images in the game.
- This project essentially creates a Bingo sheet for you to use in a game of Bingo. Once you run the program, you'll be prompted on whether you wish to add or remove a token and the number of the token you would like add/remove, in that order.
- Follow the instructions and you should have little issues.
- To quit,just close the program.

## Credits

- I do not own any of the images in this project, but I did recolour the tokens to fit certain colour schemes.
